**Command: User**
All commands that related to the user, such as user info, user settings, etc.

**`/user stats`**
Shows the user's stats.

**`/user link`**
Link your Discord account to Esefex.
The bot will send you a DM with a link to the website.
Open the link and click on the button to link your account.
Afterwards you can either open the Desktop app or the WebUI.

Esefex will not be able to send you DMs if you have disabled DMs from server members.
Esefex does not store any information about you, except for your Discord ID and your username.
This is needed so the bot knows in what channel to play the sound and what permissions you have.

**`/user unlink`**
Unlink your Discord account from Esefex. 
This will remove all tokens and sessions from the database meaning you will have to link your account again.
This command is useful if you think your Esefex Token/Session has been compromised.
It has to be noted though that a compromised token/session is not the biggest deal as it can only be used to play sounds in voices channels you are connected to.
**Important Reminder: This command will not help you if your Discord account has been compromised. Please contact Discord Support instead.**
