**General Information**
Esefex is a bot based soundboard that allows you to play sounds in your voice channel. 
It is currently in development and is not yet ready for public use. 
If you would like to contribute, please contact me on Discord `@jo_kil`.

**Getting Started**
To get started, use the `/user link` command to link your Discord account to Esefex.
This is required for the bot to know who you are and what permissions you have.
It will not save any personal information about you, only your Discord ID and your username.
You can unlink your account at any time by using the `/user unlink` command.

**Sounds**
Sounds are the main feature of Esefex.
You can play sounds by using the Web UI or Desktop Client.
Sounds can be added, removed, and edited using the `/sound` commands.

**Permissions**
Esefex uses a permission system to determine what you can and cannot do.
As the slash commands are rather limited, you will need to use the `/permisssion` commands to change permissions.
